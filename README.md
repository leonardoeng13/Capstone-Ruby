- Run a program using the command line.
- Use Ruby syntax for basic programming operations.
- Apply Ruby best practices and language style guides in code.
- Describe the SOLID principles of OOP.
- Implement classes and objects in Ruby.
- Understand the four main principles of OOP.
- Implement encapsulation and inheritance with Ruby.
- Create a UML class diagram.
- Explain the difference between associations, aggregations, and composition in OOP.
- Set up associations between classes and objects.
- Store data in files.
